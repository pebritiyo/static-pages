	We’re sorry, but WebPlatform.org is currently having a few issues. Don’t worry, you didn’t break anything. Wait a few minutes, then try again.

<h2>By the way, do you know what a 503 error is?</h2>
<p>
	Every HTTP request returns a three digit code in the beginning which communicates how everything went in a compact way.
	These numbers are known as HTTP status codes. 
	Specifically, 503 is a code that means “Service unavailable”, i.e. the server is currently unavailable, usually because it is overloaded or down for maintenance.
